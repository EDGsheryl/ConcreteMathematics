# Question 

All horses are the same color; we can prove this by induction on the number of horses in a given set. Here's how: " If there's just one horse then it's the same color as itself, so the basis is trivial. For the induction step, assume that there are n horses numbered 1 to n. By the induction hypothesis, horses 1 through n−1 are the same color, and similarly horses 2 through n are the same color. But the middle horses, 2 through n − 1, can't change color when they're in different groups; these are horses, not chameleons. So horses 1 and n must be the same color as well, by transitivity. Thus all n horses are the same color; QED." What, if anything, is wrong with this reasoning?

# Answer

We get the point of this solving which is following:

- The Color of $1$~$n-1$ horses are same
- The Color of $2$~$n$ horses are same
- The Color of $2$~$n-1$ horses are same

=>

- The Color of $1$~$n$ horses are same

When the sentence No.3 are not correct, it will receive a uncorrect result.

The first horse is red, the second horse is blue.$2$~$n-1$ refers to no horses.
