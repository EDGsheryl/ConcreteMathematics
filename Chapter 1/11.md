# Question 

A Double Tower of Hanoi contains 2n disks of n different sizes, two of each size. As usual, we're required to move only one disk at a time, without putting a larger one over a smaller one. 

### a: How many moves does it take to transfer a double tower from one peg to another, if disks of equal size are indistinguishable from each other?
### b: What if we are required to reproduce the original top-to-bottom order of all the equal-size disks in the final arrangement?

# Answer

### a:

$$Q_n=\begin{cases}
2,\;if\;(n=1)\\
2Q_{n-1}+2,\;else
\end{cases}
$$

so $Q_n+2 = 2(Q_{n-1}+2) = 2^2(Q_{n-2}+2) = 2^{n-1}(Q_{1}+2)=2^{n+1}$
so $Q_n=2^{n+1}-2$

### b:

Consider put the bottom of the towers.

We should move Q_{n-1} steps for moving towers from A to B,then moving the biggest one from A to C.
moving back from B to A, moving that one from C to B,moving $2(n-1)$ towers from A to B, moving the last one from A to C.Moving $2(n-1)$ from B to A,Moving another biggest one from B to A.moving from A to C.

it cost $Q_{n-1}+1+Q_{n-1}+1+Q_{n-1}+1+Q_{n-1}+1+Q_{n-1} = 5Q_{n-1}+4$

it means that 

$$Q_n=\begin{cases}
3,\;if\;(n=1)\\
5Q_{n-1}+4,\;else
\end{cases}
$$

so $Q_n+1 = 5(Q_{n-1}+1) = 5^2(Q_{n-2}+1) = 5^{n-1}(Q_{1}+1)=4*5^{n-1}$
so $Q_n=4*5^{n-1}-1$

Maybe it's right QwQ...
