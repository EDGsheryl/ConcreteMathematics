# Question 

A "Venn diagram" with three overlapping circles is often used to illustrate the eight possible subsets associated with three given sets:

Can the sixteen possibilities that arise with four given sets be illustrated by four overlapping circles?

# Answer

Maybe not.

I try adding a circle to the old image, but faild.

The new circle will make 3-circles image with circle A and circle B. The new circle will make 3-circles image with circle C and circle B.The new circle will make 3-circles image with circle A and circle C. I think it won't appear
in 2-D plane.

Perhaps ball can do that.
