# Question 

Let $H(n) = J(n+1) − J(n)$. Equation (1.8) tells us that $H(2n) = 2$, and $H(2n+1) = J(2n+2)−J(2n+1) = 2J(n+1)−1 − 2J(n)+1 = 2H(n)−2$.
for all $n \ge 1$. Therefore it seems possible to prove that $H(n) = 2$ for all n, by induction on n. What's wrong here?

# Answer

$H(2n+1) = 2H(n)−2$

We can't use $H(n)=2$ to deduce $H(n)=2$. 

And $H(1)\neq2 ...$
