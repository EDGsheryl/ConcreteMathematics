# Question 

What's the maximum number of regions definable by n zig-zag lines,

$ZZ_2=12$

each of which consists of two parallel infinite half-lines joined by a straight segment?

# Answer

Well it's quiet complex...

$ZZ_1=0$

considering the $ZZ_n$ . At first, we add a line cross all the line of $ZZ_{n-1}$, it adds $3n-2$ space, adding another line which is parallel, it adds $3n-2$ space, the last line cross all the line of $ZZ_{n-1}$,but it's a segment, so it adds $3n-3-1+2$ space .

So , if we are right, it will be :

$ZZ_n = ZZ_{n-1}+9n-8$
$ZZ_n = ZZ_{n-2}+(9n-8)+(9(n-1)-8)$
$ZZ_n = ZZ_{1}+(9n-8)+(9(n-1)-8)+...+(9*2-8)$
$ZZ_n = \frac{9n^2}{2}-\frac{7n}{2}-1$

Well , there is no $n=1$ condition...
