# Question 

Some of the regions defined by n lines in the plane are infinite, while others are bounded. What's the maximum possible number of bounded regions?

# Answer

$f(x) = $ the number of the plane
$g(x) = $ the number of the infinite plane
$h(x) = $ the number of the bounded plane

so $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$

|x|f(x)|g(x)|h(x)|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|2|2|0|
|2|4|4|0|
|3|7|6|1|
|4|11|8|3|
|5|16|10|6|

OK,it works. so:

$h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$
$h(x) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}+1 - 2n$
$h(x) = \frac{n^2}{2}-\frac{3n}{2} +1$
$h(x) = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$
