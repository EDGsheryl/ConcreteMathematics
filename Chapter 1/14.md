# Question 

How many pieces of cheese can you obtain from a single thick piece by making five straight slices? (The cheese must stay in its original position while you do all the cutting, and each slice must correspond to a plane in 3D.) Find a recurrence relation for $P_n$, the maximum number of threedimensional regions that can be defined by n different planes.

# Answer

$P_{n} = P_{n-1}+C_{n-1}^{0}+C_{n-1}^{1}+C_{n-1}^{2}$

I don't know why
