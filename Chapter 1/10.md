# Question 

Let $Q_n$ be the minimum number of moves needed to transfer a tower of n disks from A to B if all moves must be clockwise —— that is, from A to B, or from B to the other peg, or from the other peg to A. Also let $R_n$ be the minimum number of moves needed to go from B back to A under this restriction. Prove that

$$Q_n=\begin{cases}
0,if\;(n=0)\\
2R_{n-1}+1,else\\
\end{cases}
$$

$$R_n=\begin{cases}
0,if\;(n=0)\\
Q_{n}+Q_{n-1}+1,else\\
\end{cases}
$$

(You need not solve these recurrences; we'll see how to do that in Chapter 7.)

# Answer

$Q_n$ means the moving steps from A to B, or from B to C, or from C to A
$R_n$ means the moving steps from B to A, or from C to B, or from A to C

$$Q_n=\begin{cases}
0,if\;(n=0)\\
2R_{n-1}+1,else\\
\end{cases}
$$

It means that moving $n-1$ towers from A to C , then moving a tower from A to B, then moving $n-1$ towers from C to B.

$$R_n=\begin{cases}
0,if\;(n=0)\\
Q_{n}+Q_{n-1}+1,else\\
\end{cases}
$$

$R_n=2R_{n-1}+Q_{n-1}+2$

It means that moving $n-1$ towers from B to A , then moving a tower from B to C, then moving $n-1$ towers from A to B, moving a tower from C to A, then moving $n-1$ towers from B to A.
